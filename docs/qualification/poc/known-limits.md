# MAVI PoC — known limits

**Profile:** `poc-single-host` (ADR-020). **Not Production-qualified. Evidence class: Development.** Every capability below is a proof of concept; its results are candidate evidence, never operational truth.

This page is the PoC's record of what each capability does not do. The operator UI carries the same statements on the System / About page (`src/web/mavi-web/src/features/system/PlateKnownLimits.tsx`, which a test holds to the numbers here). Slices add their capability's section; S13 (register row D3) completes it.

## Plate reading (Stage 4; slice S3, register rows C4.1–C4.3)

- **Composition.** PD5 (PP-OCRv5 mobile detection, PaddlePaddle official ONNX, Apache-2.0) detects plates in a Vehicle Track's evidence crops; OC1-S (fast-plate-ocr `cct_s_v2_global`, MIT) reads them (plan decision D4). Both are unverified Development Model Packs; each licence is read from the pack's own LICENSE at install. They run on CPU (`plates-onnx-v1`); GPU plates are not available in the PoC yet.
- **Measured capability, proxy data only.** The Development pilot on the BDD100K H3 holdout (`docs/qualification/stage4/anpr-dev-pilot-2026-10-17.md`, Issue #225, PR #226): exact plate search returned the associated Track for **52/110** ground-truth vehicles with a usable plate text, and for **45/79** of those whose plate the reference reader could read (oracle-readable). The main losses are Track association and evidence that does not show the plate, not OCR. BDD100K is US dash-camera footage, not fixed CCTV.
- **No Indian plates.** No Indian plate data exists in MAVI's evidence, and no accuracy is claimed for Indian plates or for any data beyond the numbers above. An Indian plate corpus is post-PoC work (plan §7, O1B).
- **Demo-corpus behaviour is not a measurement.** The PoC demo clips carry no plate ground truth (register B5); a plate read on a demo clip shows the pipeline working, not its accuracy.
- **Candidates, not identifications.** A reading is a model output with a confidence. Check it against the plate crop and the source frame before acting on it. The Stage-4 acceptance register (`docs/reviews/2026-10-12-stage4-anpr-ocr-acceptance.md`, frozen) is unchanged: evidence adequacy INADEQUATE (53/79), no model selection, no Production claim.
- **Re-analysis authorisation is interim.** `POST /api/plates/reanalysis` needs an owner-configured operator key until ADR-010 operator identity (S11-min) replaces it; with no key it is refused. The key is shared (anyone holding it is authorised, nobody is attributed), and its strength is the owner's: the platform stores only its unsalted SHA-256, which local users can read.
